"DESCRIPTION":

A Chrome Extension for Productivity Analysis and Time Tracking built using Next.js is a web-based tool designed to help users monitor and optimize their online activities. This extension automatically tracks the time spent on different websites and categorizes them as productive (e.g., coding, learning platforms) or unproductive (e.g., social media, entertainment). By integrating Next.js, it provides a fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly frontend for rendering user dashboards and analytics.

The extension runs in the browser and captures URL activity, sending this data to a backend API built with Next.js API routes or connected to external services (like a database). Users can log in securely, view daily/weekly reports, and receive visual analytics—such as charts and graphs—on how they spend their time. Features like goal setting, alerts for overuse, and productivity scores enhance user engagement.

This full-stack solution combines the power of React-based UI (Next.js), Chrome APIs, and optionally a backend database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage, providing a seamless and insightful productivity tool.
